Every test question is accompanied by a specific slide followed by a **Code** or **Markdown** block in which you fill in the answer to the question. If the question has sub-questions, the accompanying **Code** or **Markdown** block(s) will already be added (don't need to manually add them). \n",

This means that you don't have to copy-pasta your code to any other cell, just run the cell which contains the declared variables and functions/methods in order to store them in memory! This will be helpful in case where the answer contains several parts, you can use the code blocks for each sub-question!\n",
